Luxon Business Days is a Luxon plugin for calculating and manipulating business days.

Inspired by [moment-business-days](https://github.com/kalmecak/moment-business-days).

## Features

- Add business days to a standard luxon `DateTime` instance. For instance, to calculate the arrival date of a shipment.
- Customizable and extendable. Configure the business working days and holidays of your business.
- Uses holiday "matcher functions" avoiding the need to continually update holiday date configs every year.

## Install

Already using luxon:

```bash
yarn add luxon-business-days
```

```diff
- import { DateTime } from 'luxon';
+ import { DateTime } from 'luxon-business-days';
// Use DateTime as normal
```

Not already using luxon:

```bash
yarn add luxon luxon-business-days
```

```javascript
import { DateTime } from 'luxon-business-days';
// Use DateTime as normal
```

## Config

Default business days:

- Monday
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Friday

Default holidays (aka shipping holidays via UPS):

- New Year's Day
- Easter Day
- Memorial Day
- Independance Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Day

#### Configure business days

```javascript
import { DateTime } from 'luxon-business-days';

const dt = DateTime.local();

// [Mon, Thur, Fri, Sun]
const awesomeFourDayBusinessWeek = [1, 4, 5, 7];

dt.setupBusiness({ businessDays: awesomeFourDayBusinessWeek });
```

#### Configure holidays

Coming soon.

## Usage

Basic:
```
import { DateTime } from 'luxon-business-days';

// Day before July 4
let dt = DateTime.local(2019, 7, 3);

dt = dt.plusBusiness(); // 7/5/19 - Friday
dt = dt.plusBusiness({ days: 2 }); // 7/9/19 - Tuesday (Skipped through Saturday/Sunday)

// Now do what you normally would with a DateTime instance.
```
